**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Participant:** Andriy Vovchak (andriyvovchak15@gmail.com) - Estonia
**Duration:** 99.7 minutes

### Prospect Profile
- **Company:** Currently consulting with agencies; previously at Avocado (joined July 2025 as executive)
- **Role:** Go-to-market operations, working with B2B agencies on lead generation and intelligence
- **Industry:** B2B SaaS/Agency operations and outbound

### Pain Points

#### Pain Point 1: Manual Company Enrichment Operations is Extremely Complex
**Description:** When enriching company data from Swiss enterprise clients, the manual process of validating websites, finding the correct entity-specific website (out of 3+ options), validating LinkedIn accounts, and identifying the right headquarters location across multiple countries is highly complex and time-consuming. This operations problem requires consuming many tables and tools in sequence.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "And they need to identify which one is the actually the one related to the Swiss entity because we need that one. So I need to first look if they exist at all and then I need to. If they. I need to validate them and then I need to find the One that is related to the Swiss agency and if I don't find any, then I need to find one related to the, the Swiss agency and then you need to do the same for the LinkedIn account and then one, once that is done then you need to find the people that are in the Swiss HQ because these are big enterprises. Imagine they are in Germany, Switzerland, France and Austria. So this flow, this is an operations problem. So how can I build an agent that basically doesn't consume 10 tables?"

#### Pain Point 2: Agencies Now Require High Bar Before Taking Outbound Clients
**Description:** B2B agencies are now highly selective about outbound work, requiring clients to already have product-market fit, clear case studies, and huge TAM before agreeing to do outbound campaigns. This makes it harder for early-stage companies to access agency outbound services.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "Because I was like in contact with many and so they basically telling you, okay, we're going to do Albon for you, but you need to have a huge stem. You need to have a clear case studies. And you need to have like product market fit."

#### Pain Point 3: Need Intelligence Layer Beyond Just Outbound
**Description:** Modern agencies recognize that outbound alone is not sufficient. They need to build an intelligence layer that includes understanding buyers who aren't ready yet, creating personalized content for warmup, and maintaining context about prospects over time. Outbound has become a commodity that requires more strategic layers.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "This is so important what you're saying because now we are hitting the limit of. Outbound is not the thing that agencies want to offer anymore or they offer it on a condition."

> "Listen, we know that you want just album, but we need to do more to go and gather that. Yeah, we need to build intelligence layer as you mentioned, to go and build content for you to warm up. Also the type of buyers that are not ready but you need to understand them. You need to create content. You need to be able to create content."

#### Pain Point 4: Building Agentic Workflows That Don't Consume Too Many Tools
**Description:** When trying to build AI agents for complex operations workflows (like the Swiss company enrichment example), there's a challenge in orchestrating multiple sequential steps without consuming excessive tables, tools, or API calls. Need a way to package complex multi-step logic into efficient agentic workflows.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "So how can I build an agent that basically doesn't consume 10 tables? Because it's literally like a same tables."

> "I think that yeah here execution is a bit of a different problem because here again like here is running in the background."

#### Pain Point 5: Technical Skill Gap in Strategy-Focused Agencies
**Description:** Agencies that are excellent at strategy and advisory struggle with the technical implementation of AI agents and automation, creating a gap between knowing what should be done and having the technical capability to execute it.

**Evidence from transcript:**
> "But they are still like keep it in their early stages especially because there are not that many extremely technical people. They're really skilled in strategy advisory. But getting into this nitiquity is a bit difficult anyway."

### Summary
Andriy is deeply engaged in B2B agency operations and faces significant challenges around building scalable, intelligent lead generation systems. His main frustrations center on the complexity of manual enrichment operations, the commoditization of basic outbound requiring intelligence layers, and the technical difficulty of building efficient agentic workflows that can handle complex multi-step processes without excessive tool consumption.
